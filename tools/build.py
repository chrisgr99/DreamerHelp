# WHAT A JACK EXPECTS, AS FACTS RATHER THAN A SENTENCE.
#
# The Rack forum has been asking for a year how to know what an input port wants — a sensible
# voltage range, whether the signal is continuous or stepped, whether it takes polyphony — and
# resorting to scopes and test rigs for the answer. Two of those three fall straight out of the
# family we already recorded for 13,711 input ports, so they are derived here rather than stored:
# the data keeps only what a person established by hand, and changing a rule below does not mean
# rewriting a hundred files.
#
# THE LINE THIS WILL NOT CROSS. A volt-per-octave port IS one volt per octave and IS continuous;
# that is what the standard means. A trigger or gate port is stepped because the signal is a state
# rather than a value — but its HEIGHT is not decided by the family, since 5V and 10V gates are
# both common, so no range is claimed. Audio and CV get continuity and nothing else: both have a
# conventional range, and "conventionally" would be doing all the work in that sentence. A port's
# real range is a fact about the module, and this project has already been bitten once by numbers
# that were plausible rather than checked.
#
# AND THE FAMILY IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN FOR THE RANGE. The families were decided for COLOUR,
# and colour tolerates a port that is pitch-ish: Bidoo's pErCO takes an attenuated frequency
# modulation whose effect depends on where a knob sits, and Impromptu's Chord-Key reads 2V as the
# twenty-fifth chord. Both are fairly drawn as pitch. Neither is one volt per octave, and saying
# so would be the same failure as a plausible constant. So the range is claimed only where the
# port's OWN LINE says per-octave — which is a fact somebody read off a manual, not an inference
# from a colour. See PER_OCTAVE below.
DERIVED = {
    'pitch':   {'step': 'continuous'},
    # A TRIGGER PORT IS STEPPED BY DEFINITION — but only if it really is one. Of 4,204
    # trigger-tagged inputs, 3,705 lines talk about gates, edges, pulses or clocks and 499 do not;
    # NYSTHI's LOGAN20 has one described as "one of the twenty voltages written into each row of
    # the file", which is a continuous CV wearing a trigger colour because the colour was chosen
    # for a jack's company rather than its contents. So this family, like CV, waits for the line
    # to agree — see STEPPED below.
    'trigger': {},
    'audio':   {'step': 'continuous'},
    # CV GETS NOTHING, and this is the same trap the range fell into. A family was chosen to
    # COLOUR a jack, and "control voltage" covers both a filter cutoff and a selector that reads
    # one chord type per volt — AaronStatic's ChordCV is exactly that. Continuous is true of most
    # of them and false of enough to matter, and there is no way to tell which from the colour. So
    # the largest family in the library says nothing about its shape until somebody establishes
    # it per port.

# one of these has had somebody read a manual and write it down, which is the standard the rest of
# this project holds to.

# AND THE RANGES ALREADY WRITTEN DOWN, IN THE SENTENCES THEY ARE HIDING IN.
#
# About a twelfth of the input lines state a range while saying something else — "Scales that
# channel's level, 0V to 10V", "A rising edge above 1V restarts every track". Somebody read those
# off a manual, so they are as good as anything a fresh scan would produce, and better than a
# convention. They are simply in prose, where nothing can sort them or compare them between
# modules, which is the whole of what the forum is asking for.
#
# WHOSE RANGE IT IS, THOUGH, IS NOT GUESSED. A line about a jack often mentions a knob or an
# output in the same breath and the figure may belong to either. So a figure counts only when it
# is in the line's opening clause with nothing else that could own it — the lines are written to
# be heard, so their clauses are marked plainly and a semicolon is a real boundary. Everything
# else is left alone for somebody to settle.
