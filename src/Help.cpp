itself, which is what the demo system already does, with the same voice.

voices at once is worse than either.

THE SYSTEM VOICE, WHICHEVER IT IS. It named a particular premium voice for a while, which is
the one this was built against — and on any machine without that voice installed `say` failed
and the reader got silence with nothing to say why. Whatever somebody has chosen in their own
settings is both more likely to be there and more likely to be what they want.

authority on whether the note exists, and a POINTER COMPARISON against that list touches nothing
the pointer points at — which matters, because reading even `gPopup->parent` to ask the question
would be the very thing that crashes. The list is a handful of widgets, so this is cheap enough

/** CMD-SHIFT-CLICK A JACK OR A KNOB.

NO MODE, NO BADGE, NOTHING ADDED TO ANYBODY'S PANEL. Cmd-shift-click any control and its note
appears beside it; the same on bare panel gives what the module is. Alt on Windows and Linux is
Cmd on a Mac — RACK_MOD_CTRL is the platform's own modifier, so one test covers all three.

WHY NOT OPTION, WHICH WAS TRIED AND SHIPPED BRIEFLY. Rack's own ScrollWidget takes alt-click
BEFORE its children and consumes it, with the comment "most widgets consume Alt-click without
needing to" — alt-drag is how the rack is panned. So an alt-click never reaches a module at all,
whatever is listening. That, and not the selected-module problem, is what defeated it.

WHY CMD-SHIFT AND NOT CMD ALONE. Cmd-drag from a jack CREATES a cable and Cmd-drag on a knob is
fine adjust at a tenth speed; taking Cmd-click would sit on top of both. Cmd-shift-drag clones a
cable, but a Cmd-shift CLICK — pressed and released without travel — does nothing in Rack at all.
So this claims the one gesture that was going spare.

AND IT WAITS FOR THE RELEASE, OVER A JACK. Whether a press is a click or the start of a drag is
not knowable when it arrives, so over a jack the press is let through and the decision made on
release, once the travel is known. Under a few pixels is a click and the note appears; anything
more was a drag and Rack's clone has it. Over a knob or bare panel nothing is at stake, so those
answer on the press and feel immediate. */

/** WHETHER THE MAKER CALLS THIS MODULE POLYPHONIC, WHICH ONLY THE MAKER CAN SAY.

The question the Rack forum keeps asking about a jack — will it take sixteen channels — has no
answer anywhere in Rack's interface, and for most modules no answer in the manual either. But
every maker fills in a list of tags for the module browser, and one of the tags is Polyphonic.
That is a declaration, in their own words, and Rack has already loaded it: it is on the Model,
so nothing has to be scanned, stored or kept in step, and it is true of the build installed rather
than of whatever is on somebody's main branch.

IT IS ABOUT THE MODULE, NOT THE JACK, so it goes on the title band with the other things that are
true of the whole module. It does not say which inputs take polyphony — that stays a blank on the
ports until somebody establishes it — but "this module handles polyphony at all" is most of what
somebody wants to know before they patch a sixteen-channel cable into it.

AND SILENCE ONLY MEANS SOMETHING WHERE THE MAKER USES TAGS. Thirty-eight of the plugins here never
apply Polyphonic to anything, so an untagged module in one of those is not a monophonic module —
it is a maker who does not use the tag. Saying "the maker does not list this as polyphonic" there
would be inventing a statement nobody made. So the plugin is asked first whether it uses the tag
at all, and where it does not, this says nothing. */
/** WHAT WE ESTABLISHED OURSELVES, WHICH OUTRANKS A TAG.

A tag is one word about a whole module, written by a maker who may have meant it about the outputs
— Bogaudio's UNISON is tagged polyphonic and every one of its inputs reads channel one only,
because it is a mono-to-poly voicer. The port fields say which jacks actually take a polyphonic
cable, each cited to a file and a line, so where they exist they are the better answer.

They also reach where a tag cannot. Thirty-eight plugins never use the tag at all — Instruo,
Bidoo, JW-Modules and dBiz among them, 423 modules — and for those the tag can say nothing,
whereas a port that was read in the maker's source says as much as any other.
